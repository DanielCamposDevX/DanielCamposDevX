📚💡 From the beginning, my journey in the tech world has been driven by curiosity and self-learning. I started by exploring my computer, taking online courses in hardware assembly and maintenance, as well as learning programming logic. Soon after, I began doing maintenance work on my own.

🎓🌎 My academic journey at UFJF gave me the opportunity to refine my skills. I was selected for the Regional Innovation and Technology Transfer Center (CRITT UFJF), a government institution. There, I worked as a scholarship program supervisor in the I.T. sector. I led projects involving Windows Server environments, intranet networks, and JavaScript development to improve internal processes, all in compliance with LGPD regulations.

🚀💼 Later, I was hired by one of the companies inside the Center, where I worked on cloud IP telephony development using Asterisk IPBX with Node.js and React interfaces for management systems. On the backend, I worked directly with UDP and TCP protocols, and administered databases such as Postgres, MongoDB, and Asterisk DB. With Node.js, I expanded the platform’s functionalities significantly. On a daily basis, I was also responsible for Bash scripting in Linux, playing a vital role in DevOps operations.

🚀💪 I am currently working as a developer at DEVIO, where I use TypeScript, JavaScript, React and React Native to build interactive applications with powerful features that help clients achieve incredible ROI. Besides developing web and mobile applications, we follow agile methodologies such as Scrum and maintain strong clean-code practices, ensuring easier maintenance after deployment and speeding up the development process. Always aiming to innovate and bring maximum results in minimum time, I remain in constant learning to stay updated with market standards and new tools, without fear of using A.I. to enhance the development workflow.

📈💪 Today, I continue to stay open to new challenges in programming while improving myself to reach new goals and achievements.
